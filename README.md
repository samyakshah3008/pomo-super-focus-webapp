### Welcome to PomoSuperFocus!

It's an all in one productivity tool - Free, open source forever, aims to bring the best version of you!

### The problem it solves:

In our day-to-day lives, people use a variety of tools to stay organized and productive. Some rely on Pomodoro timers to manage their work, others maintain to-do lists or set monthly and yearly goals. Many track habits with scorecards to build good habits and break bad ones, while some follow predefined routines or keep gratitude and bucket lists. However, there isn‚Äôt a single platform that brings all these features together under one roof. As a result, individuals are forced to juggle multiple apps or documents to revisit their day effectively. PomoSuperFocus solves this problem by offering a comprehensive, all-in-one solution where users can manage and reflect on their day seamlessly.

### Challenges:

PomoSuperFocus is free to use and open source forever, however - currently I have hosted my backend on Vercel with Free Hobby plan until I make a purchase of a paid plan. Due to this, this Free plan cannot handle heavy traffic and has certain constraints. Along with this, I am using MongoDB for Database which is also on a free plan with a limit of 500mb only. To handle this situation and make a workaround, I came up with a solution - Guest Login and Beta access upon request.

Due to this, for now, I have introduced guest login flow. Here the guest user can check all the features with the prefilled guest data upon account creation and check the whole creation flow but we won't be saving this data to our DB. Also please note that requests might take more time than expected due to free plan, but appreciate the patience for the same.

But wait, I have opened a couple of features for now which are open for EVERYONE! - They are - Eisen Hower Matrix, Habits Scorecard and precious life time tracker! Hope everyone will love them! Please note that since it is open for everyone and we are running on limited free plan, there are high chances of some potential issues. Appreciate your patience for the same!

Also, if someone wants a full access - please write me at samyakshah3008@gmail.com and I'll try my best to approve to the soonest!

Please note - Until I hit near to limit of FREE plan, PomoSuperFocus is open for everyone to create a verified account. But if you just want to try out the product, feel free to use Guest login and you can check the whole flow!

I'll soon come up with the purchase of paid plan and open all the features for everyone! If you like using this webapp and would like to sponser some amount, I'll be more than grateful for it! I'll use it to get a paid plan and increase the capacity of requests and DB storage. üíùüòªüöÄ

### Features:

2. Customizable Pomodoro: Popular Pomodoro technique - where you can study and take break depending on your customization - you can set your personalized study and break times, pick your favorite youtube or spotify playlist which will run in the background as you are on study session or break. Also we are supporting themes! For now, I have set Babuchak Jethiya as a default theme - which is taken from Indian TV comedy show - Tmkoc. If you don't know the context, just imagine your father is keeping an eye on you as you are doing your study sessions, so dare to break it;) Many more new themes will be coming very soon!

3. Eisen Hower Todolist: Prioritization in task is highly important factor so that you don't miss out on important work. Also don't forget to checkout the draggable matrix playground where you can drag one task priority to a different priority box.
