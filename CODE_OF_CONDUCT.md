# Contributor Code of Conduct
PomoSuperFocus is a free and open source project aimed at helping people stay focused and productive. While the project currently operates with some technical limitations due to using free-tier hosting services (Vercel's Free Hobby plan for backend and MongoDB's 500MB free tier for database), we remain committed to providing value to our community through features like Guest Login and Beta access.

As we grow and evolve, it's essential that we maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, whether through code contributions, issue discussions, or other forms of engagement. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by these guidelines and help us create a positive experience for everyone.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Showing compassion by feeding stray cats and animals whenever possible ðŸ˜»ðŸ’–

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits
